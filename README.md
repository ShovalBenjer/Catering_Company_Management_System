     npm install
     ```
   - For a Python-based stack:  
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Database Setup:**  
   Execute the SQL scripts found in the `/database` directory to set up the database schema and insert sample data. For example:
   ```bash
   mysql -u yourusername -p < database/PROJECT_DATA_bASE.SQL
   mysql -u yourusername -p < database/RANDOM_DATA.SQL
   ```

4. **Configure Application Settings:**

     python app.py
     ```

2. **Access Documentation:**  
   Detailed instructions, user guides, and API documentation are provided in the `/docs` directory.

## Database Setup & SQL Scripts  
This repository includes several SQL scripts to manage the catering management database:

- **PROJECT_DATA_bASE.SQL:**  
  Creates the database schema, including tables for persons, customers, employees (with specialized roles such as waiters and chefs), dishes, suppliers, events, and various junction tables.

- **QUERIES.SQL:**  
  Contains sample queries addressing business needs, such as:
  - Calculating total kosher sales per event.
  - Summing final payments to suppliers.
  - Ranking chefs by event participation.
  - Updating customer status based on recent event activity.
  - Analyzing popular dishes and financial trends.

- **RANDOM_DATA.SQL:**  
  Inserts sample records into the database for testing and demonstration purposes.

Additionally, a stored procedure (`calculate_finale_payment`) is provided to dynamically calculate event payments based on dish quantities and guest counts.

## Documentation  
Comprehensive documentation is available in the `/docs` directory and includes:
- Detailed setup instructions.
- User guides for each module (HR, client management, inventory, supplier management, and event management).
- API documentation (if applicable) and sample queries.
- ER diagrams and presentation slides explaining system objectives, challenges, and business requirements.
